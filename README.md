# Iris-Analysis
Analyzing the Iris dataset.

My answers to some scikit-learn, matplotlib, pandas, seaborn, and numpy [exercises](https://www.w3resource.com/machine-learning/scikit-learn/iris/index.php) involving the [Iris dataset](https://gist.github.com/netj/8836201). The Visualization files involve matplot lib, the kNN files involve using the k Nearest Neighbors (kNN) algorithm as implemented in scikit-learn, and the LR files involve using Logistic Regression.
